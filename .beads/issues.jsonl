This bypasses ZenStack v3 access controls. The FeedbackTable and FeedbackMutateDrawer correctly use useClientQueries(schema) from @zenstackhq/tanstack-query/react. The dashboard should be refactored to either: 1) Use ZenStack hooks for consistent data access, or 2) Verify the Elysia stats endpoint properly respects organization context (currently uses direct db queries).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-19T20:16:03.801635-03:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T20:26:24.704542-03:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T20:26:24.704542-03:00","close_reason":"Added cache invalidation for feedback-stats query in all mutation callbacks: create, update, delete, status change, and bulk delete.
