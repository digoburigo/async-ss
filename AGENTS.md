# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds


# Project Rules

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following structure using Turborepo:

- **`apps/web/`** - Frontend application (React with TanStack Router)

- **`apps/server/`** - Backend server (Elysia)

- **`packages/api/`** - Shared API logic and types with tRPC
- **`packages/auth/`** - Authentication logic and utilities with better-auth
- **`packages/zen-v3/`** - Database schema and utilities with ZenStack v3

- **`apps/expo/`** - React Native mobile app (with NativeWind)

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `pnpm run dev:spa` - Start only the server and web app

## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the server workspace:

- `pnpm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database (ZenStack v3 push)
- `pnpm run db:studio` - Open database studio (drizzle-kit studio)
- `pnpm run db:generate` - Generate ZenStack v3 files
- `pnpm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations (ZenStack v3 prisma like migrations)

Database schema files are located in `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel`

## API Structure

- Controllers for Elysia endpoints are in `apps/server/src/modules/`
- Client-side Elysia Treaty utils are in `apps/web/src/clients/api-client.ts`
- Client-side ZenStack v3 client can be imported from `@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/react` and `@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/server` and be used in the components like this:

```ts
import { schema } from "@acme/zen-v3/zenstack/schema";
import { useClientQueries } from "@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/react";

export function Model() {
const client = useClientQueries(schema);
const { data, error } = client.model.useFindMany();

if (error) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
}
return <div>Model: {data.map((model) => model.prop)}</div>;
}
```

## Authentication

Authentication is enabled in this project:

- Server auth logic is in `apps/server/src/plugins/better-auth.ts`
- Web app auth client is in `apps/web/src/clients/auth-client.ts`
- Native app auth client is in `apps/native/src/utils/auth.ts`

## Key Points

- This is a Turborepo monorepo using pnpm workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `pnpm run command-name`
- Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
